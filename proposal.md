Echo Nattinger - CAPP 30239 Static Visualization

Every election cycle, the issue of crime is a salient topic for voters all across the United States. Politicians, regardless of party, leverage messages about being "tough on crime" while others call for reform to the criminal justice system. However, oftentimes voters' opinions on crime (and thus politicians' policies on crime) do not reflect the actual trends in criminal behavior. I am interested in studying the fluctuation of crime (specifically nonviolent vs. violent crime) vs. the public opinion on crime throughout the years. I think data visualization is a particularly powerful tool for this topic, as it allows a reader to visually notice stark differences in perception versus reality. 

For this project I will rely on crime data from the following sources:

- The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
  - My main data source will be the hate crimes dataset provided by the FBI's UCR. 
  - I also plan to use the FBI's year-to-year crime rate comparison data. This is a small dataset, only 20 observations (one per year), with information on the rates of various crimes throughout the years (2004-2023). I accessed this data by clicking the "Source Data" link on [this page](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#) about national crime trends from the FBI's website. I plan to use this data to show a "snapshot" of how rates of violent and non-violent crimes have changed over time.
 

I hope to supplement these crime statistics with public opinion data from Gallup. [This link](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx) includes historical survey data on Americans' opinions of various crime and law enforcement topics. Various tables cover topics such as faith in law enforcement, feelings of safety, and perceptions of crime trends. While the time-span for each table is slightly different, each table has around ~15-30 observations -- one for each year, depending on the time frame. For example, one survey table has 25 observations, as the question was asked annually from 1999-2024. *Note that this is a supplementary data source and not the majority focus of this project.*
