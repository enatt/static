**Echo Nattinger - CAPP 30239 Static Visualization - Hate Crime Study**

In September 2024, Republican candidates and elected officials began making false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, OH. Misinformation spread rapidly and [led to Neo-Nazi groups marching throughout the town intimidating Black residents](https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/hate-groups-converge-on-springfield-following-false-claims-about-haitian-immigrants/R6BSUOAMGZDNZNSV4PUTBDPOSY/). This is only one recent example of racial and ethnic scapegoating leading to targeted violence in the United States. 

I hope to study the history, trends, and current day prevalence of hate crimes in thed United States. Not only do I want to analyze how rates in hate crimes change after certain political events, but I want to better understand who perpetrates and who is victimized by hate crimes. If we can better understand where, when, why, and how hate crimes happen, people and politicians alike can hopefully do more to prevent targeted violence in our communities. With my visualizations, I hope to demonstrate how political speech can lead to violence, and allow any viewer to better understand which social groups are disproportionately facing violence via hate crimes. 

For this project I will rely on crime data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI):
- My main data source will be the hate crimes dataset provided by the FBI's UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting Program). The data can be found on the [FBI's Crime Data Explorer](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads), specifically all the way under Additional Datasets>Hate Crime>Download. This dataset includes all the FBI's incidences of hate crimes from 1991-2023:
   - 253,777 rows/observations total.
   - For each hate crime, the FBI has recorded information on location (city/state/division), incident date, offender race and ethnicity, victim race and ethnicity, the type of "bias" that motivated the hate crime, and more (28 columns total).
- I also plan to use the FBI's year-to-year crime rate comparison data. This is a small dataset that tracks the rates of various types of crimes throughout the years 2004-2023. I accessed this data by clicking the "Source Data" link on [this page](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#) about national crime trends from the FBI's website. I want to have this data handy for any any comparisons in crime trends.
  - 20 observations/rows (one per year)
  - 20 columns representing different measures of crime
 

I'm interested in supplementing these crime statistics with public opinion data from Gallup. [This link](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx) includes historical survey data on Americans' opinions of various crime and law enforcement topics. I think it could be interesting to study how people feel about law enforcement in conjunction with changes in hate crime prevalence. Various tables cover topics such as faith in law enforcement, feelings of safety, and perceptions of crime trends. While the time-span for each table is slightly different, each table has around ~15-30 observations -- one for each year, depending on the time frame -- and 2-6 columns representing different survey answer choices. For example, one survey table has 25 observations, as the question was asked annually from 1999-2024, and 6 columns for different survey responses. While the data is not in csv form, each table can easily be copy-pasted into a csv. *Note that this is a supplementary data source and not the majority focus of this project.*
