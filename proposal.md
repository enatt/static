Echo Nattinger - CAPP 30239 Static Visualization

Every election cycle, the issue of crime is a salient topic for voters all across the United States. Politicians, regardless of party, leverage messages about being "tough on crime" while others call for reform to the criminal justice system. However, oftentimes voters' opinions on crime (and thus politicians' policies on crime) do not reflect the actual trends in criminal behavior. I am interested in studying the fluctuation of crime (specifically nonviolent vs. violent crime) vs. the public opinion on crime throughout the years. I think data visualization is a particularly powerful tool for this topic, as it allows a reader to visually notice stark differences in perception versus reality. 

For this project I will rely on two types of data:

- Crime data
  - I intend to use crime statistics data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

- Public opinion data
  - I intend to use polling data from Gallup
